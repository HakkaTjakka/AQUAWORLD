# AQUAWORLD
Minecraft 1.12.2

Deleted directory REGION
New upload now busy in REGION_NEW_UPLOAD (94 to go)

Next will be endless 3d maze generator used with cubic chunks (same vertical down/up / depth(in y-direction)/height as horizontal east/west/north/south / width/depth(in z-direction...)). With booby traps, dynamite, and finding solution by blowing up whole dead-end paths large zoo animals with interiors aquducts globes etc. All cpu generated from scratch with random generators, that also will work on x y and z axis so the world apering will never be the same, just like some biome generator, but then on nitro. Like with just like this 2d version (flat maze in 3d...), with mazes that run throught the mazes with bigger sized walls/floors. Running through all sorts of computer generated stuff you won't believe your eyes. (If you come up with suggerstions...). But then in 3d. Wet your but chest! (Translate to Dutch (Nederlands), then back to English.... If you are not Dutch, you still don't understand.... But hey! Ask yourself why Google doesn't translate the translated back into the original language it started with, then compare the two, and then change it as long it takes to get the same back!!! Then it knows it has translated it well. And somebody reading the translation, translates it back to original, IT ALSO GETS THE SAME BACK HOW IT WAS BEFORE THE TRANSLATION!!!

I think i'm the Einstein of the 20th cencury! ;)
