# AQUAWORLD
Minecraft 1.12.2

Uploading now new made version... 27 x 27 region files. 13.8 x 13.8 kilometers. 191 square kilomters. Tenthousands kilometers or railtracks. Creation time 1 day.
Convert to 1.13+ yourself for activating multiple command command blocks. (Don't work in 1.12.2 and/or Bedrock, shame on Mojang/Microsoft).

Some region files seems to be missing. Will generate mazeworld soon again then update....
Play with 1.14.4+ for cascade multiple command command blocks on bedrock floor. Start of blocks are in center of region file (region x * 512 + 256, 1, region z * 512 + 256)
